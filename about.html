            <p>I grew up in Wisconsin all my life and always loved being outside and staying active. I had some complicated
                life events happened and I had all of that taken away from me. I had to find a new passion and took 
                inspiration from my dad, that being computer programming. I took as many classes as I could in highschool,
                had an internship, and started to go to college for it even. I eventually made the switch to Lambda School
                so that I could jumpstart my career, seeing as college wasn't really for me, it was more just a means 
                to an end.
